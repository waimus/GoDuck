# GoDuck
Ridiculously quick and basic implementation of DuckDuckGo *summary* search API using Godot Engine and GDScript. In a very messy state at the moment.


## Open in Godot
Using Godot Engine version 3.2.3 stable official (Steam). May work using other Godot versions.

* Open Godot project manager
* Import
* Load the `project.godot` file in the `goducksearch` folder
